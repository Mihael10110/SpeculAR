# Prototype Documentation

SpeculAR was produced to serve as an tool for conducting a user-centric evaluation of the
publics perception of an augmented social space representing their shared interests.

## Deployment:
The unity project of SpeculAR can be built to an apk and deployed on a Meta Quest 3 System.

## User Manual:
After loading, SpeculAR will display the passthrough view of the camera on the AR headset. When
in this mode, the user can place the initial anchor to initialize the real-world reference by holding
the left touch controller at the calibration location and pressing the trigger button. The calibration
location is set on the outer edge of the bottom window sill located at the front corner of the Coop
City St. Gallen, at the rst seam on the window sill on the side of the display window (the side of
the building without the entrance to the store). When calibrating the controller should be placed in
our calibration mount and the controller should face towards the direction of the bus station (See
Figure 1). The object manipulation is tied to the right controller, where the options to rotate and toggle
objects are mapped to the trigger and grip button respectively.
